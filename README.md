Polyarchy Viewer aims to provide interactivity and represent the relationships of the three hierarchies: 1) Theme, 2) Field of research (FOR) codes and, 3) Staff. The initial issue in developing the Polyarchy Viewer includes creating an application that is able to show all the intersecting hierarchies together without cluttering the use interface while presenting all the extra information such as strength of relationship to the user.
